#DEV DISCONTINUED
# What is a Wrapper-For-MITMF?
Its designed to make using MITMF easier for people who dont use it often.

#Pre Req:
1. Install MITMF.py (see his repo for details)(https://github.com/byt3bl33d3r/MITMf)
2. Make sure it works on your machine

#To Use:
1. Download Script
2. Run in terminal

##Disclaimer: I dont recommend using anything on here to anyone else for any reason. Scipts here may work, but most likely will break a system they are run on. If you use them you do so at your own risk. Also NEVER use anything in any of my repos to attempt or break into anything that you do not own.
